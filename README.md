# Rock-Paper-Scissros
I made a simple rock-paper-scissors game in C language.

 ------- How to play -------
 
 
 You can start by pressing Y key and exit by pressing N key.

After starting, you have to enter the initials of the option you have chosen, and a random selection is made on the computer
and the result is determined according to the choices made.

Games consist of one round.
